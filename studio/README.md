# Grafeno Studio

The graphical interface of Grafeno. It connects to a Grafeno engine
through its HTTP API (the engine itself has no interface). Everything can be
done from it, without a terminal:

- **Overview**: namespaces (empty ones too, with their creation date),
  counts per label, quick actions. The namespace menu at the top switches
  between namespaces or creates a new one, and says which it did; creating
  a name that exists offers to switch to it instead.
- **Explorer**: filter by label, name or text; create nodes; edit names,
  labels, properties (typed: text, number, yes/no, JSON), text and
  importance in place; add, end, retract or delete facts; select several
  nodes to archive or delete them.
- **Graph**: a live, physics-driven graph you handle directly. Drag nodes
  and the rest reacts (dragged nodes stay pinned); hover or select one to
  light its neighborhood; shift-click or shift-drag a lasso to select
  several and move, pin, hide or delete them together; drag the `+` of a
  selected node onto another to connect them; double-click to expand
  neighbors; right-click for every action on nodes, facts or the canvas.
  Zoom at the cursor, pan with momentum, a minimap, find a node to fly to
  it, travel in time with “valid at”. Color by community (Louvain, label
  propagation, connected components), collapse a community into one node,
  and size nodes by centrality (PageRank, degree, betweenness), computed
  over the whole namespace. Keys: Delete, Esc, F, H, P, + and -.
- **Scripts**: a GQ workspace like a SQL editor. Several scripts in tabs
  (kept in the browser, opened from and saved to `.gq` files), highlighting
  and completion (keywords, functions, the namespace's labels,
  pseudo-properties), a schema panel with snippets, Ctrl+Enter to run the
  statement under the cursor or the selection, F5 to run the whole script
  (each statement in its own transaction, stopping at the first error, whose
  line is marked). Results per statement as a table, JSON, graph, bar or
  line chart, or the `PROFILE` steps, with CSV and JSON export, and a messages log with times and changes.
- **Search**: full text, recall with its signals, context within a token
  budget.
- **Memory**: duplicates to merge, weak memories to archive, groups to
  consolidate.
- **Administration**: who the Studio is connected as and, for owners, the
  access keys (create with grants per namespace, own-records-only and
  owner options; the secret is shown once; revoke); indexes, check,
  rebuild, export, import, a backup of the whole database file (owners),
  and deleting the namespace with everything in it (after a
  confirmation).

Ctrl+K opens a command palette (views, actions, namespaces and nodes).

The look is "graph lab": dark first (light, or the system's choice, from
the switch at the bottom of the rail), a floating rail and command bar in
glass over the canvas, Space Grotesk for the interface and JetBrains Mono
for data and code. Both typefaces are bundled (SIL Open Font License), so
the Studio needs no network beyond its server.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` serves it with live reload and forwards `/v1` and `/health`
to a `grafeno serve` on `127.0.0.1:7810` (start one first, for example
`grafeno serve --memory`), or to the server in `GRAFENO_URL`.

```bash
npm run build
```

`npm run build` writes `dist/`. The build uses relative paths and hash
routing, so `dist/` can be hosted on any static server. Point it at a
Grafeno engine started with `--cors-origin <that origin>`.

It calls the API through the TypeScript client in `../client`.

The same build is the desktop app's window (`../desktop`). There,
`src/desktop.ts` sends requests through the app, the start screen opens
database files or connects to a server, files are saved with dialogs and
the native menu drives the views.
